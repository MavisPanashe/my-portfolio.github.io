										<h1>Summative Assessment: Individual Presentation</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p>Developing a neural network for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset proved to be a stimulating endeavour that expanded my understanding of machine learning and deep learning principles. One of the highlights of the project was the accessibility of the data itself; the CIFAR-10 dataset is readily available through the keras-datasets library, which greatly streamlined the initial stages of loading, pre-processing, and exploring the images as a beginner in using python. This efficiency allowed me to invest more time in fine-tuning the neural network architecture and experimenting with various optimisation strategies.</p>
<p>The construction of the model involved partitioning a portion of the training set for validation purposes, ensuring there was a separate dataset dedicated to evaluating the model’s performance as it learned. This step reinforced the importance of rigorous methodology: by preventing data leakage, I was better positioned to assess whether my choices regarding network layers, activation functions, and hyperparameters were truly effective. The architecture I implemented consisted of several convolutional layers, interspersed with pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. This design successfully captured important features of the dataset, and through the validation set, I could systematically monitor signs of overfitting and adjust the model’s complexity as needed.</p>
<p>Notably, I learned valuable lessons about communicating complex technical information effectively. Preparing a 20-minute recorded presentation, supported by concise and visually oriented slides, underscored the necessity of clear organisation and pacing. While I felt the overall structure of my slides and their minimal text effectively showcased the model’s development process, I recognised room for improvement in optimising speech flow to fit the allotted time without rushing or oversimplifying as I had to cut down on a few things I wanted to add. On reflection, rehearsing more frequently with a timer would help refine the pacing and eliminate any disjointed transitions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this project was instructive on multiple levels. From a technical standpoint, it deepened my appreciation for the fine balance between a model’s capacity and its tendency to overfit. From a presentation perspective, it highlighted the importance of cohesively organising content for diverse audiences who might vary in their familiarity with artificial intelligence concepts. Looking ahead, I plan to incorporate more advanced hyperparameter exploration techniques, strengthen data augmentation methods, and delve into transfer learning options to further enhance performance. Through consistent refinement of both my analytical and communication skills, I aim to develop more robust and innovative solutions in future machine learning projects.</p>
