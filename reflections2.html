              <h1>Reflective Commentary on Research Methods and Professional Practice</h1>
            </header>

            <p>Over the past twelve weeks the Research Methods and Professional Practice (RM&amp;PP) module has pushed me from “method curious” to a more rounded, ethically grounded researcher practitioner. Our brief was to interrogate research philosophies, master core quantitative and qualitative techniques, and connect them to real world professional codes. My journey was documented through an e‑portfolio that now spans ethical discussion posts, a generative AI governance essay, a structured literature review plan, multiple statistics worksheets, and a mixed methods research proposal for the NHS. This reflection maps those artefacts against the module learning outcomes (LOs), examines the emotions that surfaced, evaluates feedback received, and distils the skills I will carry forward.</p>

            <h2>1 Clarifying the learning outcomes and tasks</h2>
            <p>LO1 asked us to apply professional codes and research ethics. I met this through the Abi selective reporting debate, posting an initial argument, two peer responses and a final synthesis that wove in the ACM, RSS and UK consumer protection regulations. LO2 focused on critical appraisal of contemporary research problems. My Generative AI governance reflection dissected 200 policy documents and compared hard law versus soft law regimes across the EU, US, UK and China. LO3 targeted methodological design and planning. I satisfied this with a literature review blueprint on NHS digital systems and a mixed methods proposal culminating in a conference style presentation and transcript. Finally, LO4 required quantitative data analysis and interpretation, evidenced by my Statistical Inference e‑portfolio covering t‑tests, summary measures and explanatory commentary. Together these artefacts demonstrate coverage of the full outcome set.</p>

            <h2>2 Emotional response and critical self analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Initial anxiety and impostor feelings.</strong> Week 1’s ethics case provoked mild panic because I worried my legal grasp was thin. Drafting the first post transformed that anxiety into productive tension. I spent an extra evening reviewing the Food Information Regulation to ensure accuracy. The relief on posting morphed into pride when two peers quoted my “reasonable foresight” argument. Gibbs’ reflective cycle (1988) labels this a valued outcome stage. Positive feedback closed the loop and reinforced my confidence.</p>
            <p><strong>Statistical trepidation.</strong> Excel based hypothesis testing felt mechanical at first. Midway through Unit 7 I mis interpreted an F test and nearly selected an unequal variance t test. Catching the error triggered embarrassment, but also sharpened vigilance. I now perform a checklist before running any inferential test. Kolb’s experiential model (1984) would describe this as concrete experience to reflective observation to abstract conceptualisation to active experimentation. I immediately integrated the checklist into the Diet A/B analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Euphoria tempered by caution.</strong> Writing about generative AI governance was exhilarating because it was a chance to merge policy analysis with my coding background. Yet the literature revealed alarming enforcement gaps and I felt an ethical unease. Would my own future ML projects contribute to that governance vacuum. This discomfort nudged me to embed an “ethics gate” in my research proposal’s software development life cycle.</p>

            <h2>3 Influence of external feedback and literature</h2>
            <p>Peer comments were catalytic. One classmate reframed Abi’s dilemma as “epistemic manipulation,” pushing me to expand beyond code of conduct compliance towards sociological concepts of knowledge power. Another peer challenged my AI essay for Global North bias, prompting a late night dive into Kenyan AI policy papers and a paragraph on geographic asymmetry. Literature also reshaped me. Correa et al.’s (2023) meta analysis, cited in my AI reflection, highlighted vague definitional overlap, convincing me to create a cross walk matrix in the NHS project plan.</p>

            <h2>4 Learning mechanisms and changed actions</h2>
            <p>Three instructional design elements drove genuine learning.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Scaffolded, progressive artefacts. The early ethics post established a foundation of citation rigour that later flowed into the AI essay and research proposal.</li>
              <li>Authentic assessment. Analysing real NHS case studies meant that every statistic or framework felt consequential, not hypothetical.</li>
              <li>Peer led dialogue. Weekly discussion board deadlines created an iterative feedback loop reminiscent of Schön’s reflection in action (1983).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As a result, my approach to evidence changed. I now preregister analysis plans. In the proposal I mandate interrupted time series scripts to be open sourced, and I habitually triangulate qualitative and quantitative strands.</p>

            <h2>5 Evidence of skills and knowledge gained</h2>
            <p>The artefacts contain tangible proof.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Statistical competence. Correct use of paired and independent t tests, effect size interpretation and visual critiques of assumptions.</li>
              <li>Research design literacy. A structured literature review protocol with clearly bounded scope, inclusion criteria and PRISMA ready headings.</li>
              <li>Ethical and governance acumen. AI governance essay demonstrates ability to map multi jurisdictional regulations and translate them into SDLC gates.</li>
              <li>Presentation skills. A 17 slide deck and scripted pitch delivered to peers, using data visual elements and timeline planning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6 Individual contribution to collaborative work</h2>
            <p>Although most assessments were individual, the ethics forum served as a mini group project. I initiated the discussion thread early, cited five legal sources, and posed two open questions to spark debate. Subsequent peer replies referenced my clauses and I synthesised the discussion into a closing post that articulated shared responsibility models. The experience honed my facilitation skills, setting norms for citation accuracy and collegial critique that I will replicate when chairing interdisciplinary research meetings.</p>

            <h2>7 Application to real world contexts</h2>
            <p>The mixed methods NHS proposal is already earmarked for a summer placement with an Acute Trust informatics team. By baking in stakeholder interviews and a Tableau dashboard, I will provide clinicians with actionable benchmarks rather than a thesis gathering dust. Likewise, the AI governance cross walk has been forwarded to a compliance officer contact as a draft template for future foundation model deployments.</p>

            <h2>8 Integrity and referencing</h2>
            <p>Throughout the module I adopted Harvard style, double checking every secondary citation. Using Zotero cured earlier habits of missing page numbers. In the e‑portfolio I embedded legible screenshots of Excel outputs beneath each statistical interpretation so the marker can verify calculations without inflating the word count, in line with guidance. No plagiarism flags surfaced in the formative Turnitin run, confirming that paraphrases were sufficiently original.</p>

            <h2>9 Conclusion and forward view</h2>
            <p>Emotionally I traversed anxiety, curiosity and cautious optimism. Intellectually I progressed from methodological novice to someone capable of designing an auditable, ethically sound mixed methods study. The evidence base, forum posts, governance critique, review protocol, statistical analyses and a live research proposal, demonstrates growth across all learning outcomes. Next semester I intend to deepen reflexive practice by scheduling fortnightly “meta journals,” ensuring that emotional cues continue to guide methodological rigor, not derail it. By translating classroom insights into workplace and NHS contexts, I aim to embody the module’s ultimate lesson. Robust research and professional practice are inseparable.</p>
