										<h1>Reflections</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I have spent the past several months immersing myself in a variety of projects, discussions, and hands-on exercises that have broadened my understanding of machine learning, data science, and the ethical and social implications surrounding new technologies. Early in this process, I was involved in a collaborative discussion about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where my peers and I delved into the ways emerging innovations—ranging from artificial intelligence to robotics—might reshape industries and labour markets. At that time, I was struck not only by the potential benefits of these advances but also by the profound questions they raise: how might displacement of certain jobs affect communities, and what responsibilities do developers bear when building systems that can alter entire economic sectors? The conversation reminded me that machine learning does not exist in isolation, but forms part of a wider technological wave that prompts us to consider both our hopes and our concerns for the future.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, I participated in a second collaborative debate, this time exploring the legal and ethical dimensions of artificial neural networks. Whereas the earlier discussion had emphasised broad socio-economic themes, this debate focussed more directly on concrete issues such as intellectual property, data privacy, and algorithmic bias. I recall one group member pointing out how an automated system, even when built with the best intentions, could reinforce unfair biases if trained on historically skewed data. This encouraged me to think critically about the balance between technological advancement and accountability. By the end of this debate, I felt a sharper awareness of the need for data scientists to anticipate legal pitfalls and ensure ethical considerations underpin their work from inception to deployment.</p>
<p>Equipped with these perspectives, I moved on to a substantial data analysis project that would put my theoretical knowledge to practical use. Working GitHub, my team and I examined a publicly available dataset, AB_NYC_2019.csv, capturing Airbnb listings in New York City. Our goal was to perform a comprehensive business analysis and build a modestly performing predictive model. The first step involved cleaning and exploring data on over 48,000 listings. We looked closely at variables such as neighbourhood, room type, availability, and number of reviews, hypothesising these factors might influence listing prices. The initial exploratory analysis provided insights into how property location and type of accommodation correlated with higher or lower nightly rates. We then built a regression model aiming to estimate listing prices, though we quickly discovered that the real world is rarely straightforward, and price variability depends on myriad unrecorded factors. Our model ultimately explained around 57% of the observed variation—an indication that, while we had captured many crucial determinants, plenty remained outside the model’s scope. Still, the findings were valuable. By identifying the most influential variables, we could advise hosts on how to refine their pricing strategies and indicate the attributes Airbnb might highlight to optimise revenue. This project underscored the balance between technical precision and practical applicability: even a model with moderate explanatory power can deliver actionable insights if one interprets the results with caution and an understanding of real-world complexity.</p>
<p>In parallel with this large-scale exploratory work, I undertook a smaller but illuminating exercise using the well-known Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here, my objective was to perform clustering with k=3 to see if the unsupervised algorithm would neatly capture the three species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. Although the dataset itself is small and widely studied, the process of selecting k, interpreting cluster centroids, and evaluating the cohesion of each group gave me a fresh perspective on unsupervised learning. Unlike in a supervised setting, there were no direct labels guiding the algorithm’s search for patterns. It fell to me to compare the resulting clusters with what I knew from domain knowledge and to use metrics designed for unsupervised approaches. This exercise reaffirmed the importance of understanding a dataset’s characteristics before picking a method: an algorithm can perform well quantitatively while still failing to yield meaningful or interpretable groupings if the data do not suit the chosen technique. Even a classic dataset can reveal new insights and remind us how crucial it is to question each assumption we bring to our analyses.</p>
<p>My final major undertaking was delivering a presentation on developing a neural network for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project proved to be both challenging and deeply rewarding, as it required me to weave together principles from machine learning, deep learning, and practical experimentation. CIFAR-10 is known for its variety of small, low-resolution images spanning objects like aeroplanes, dogs, and trucks, which forces a model to differentiate between subtle visual features. I experimented with convolutional layers, activation functions, and different optimisation strategies. In truth, progress was not entirely linear: I frequently grappled with issues such as overfitting and unsteady validation loss. Yet each obstacle became an opportunity to refine my technique and deepen my knowledge of hyperparameter tuning. Delivering the presentation allowed me to translate my technical efforts into a coherent narrative for an audience, showcasing the model’s architecture, the rationale behind my decisions, and the lessons learned from both successes and setbacks. Standing in front of my peers, I felt a genuine sense of achievement, not just from the respectable accuracy score but also from the ability to articulate my journey with clarity and confidence.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I am determined to continue honing my abilities by tackling projects that blend rigorous analytical methods with reflections on real-world impacts. I now recognise that a well-tuned model or a polished data visualisation is just one part of a larger endeavour: one must also keep in mind how stakeholders will use the insights, whether the chosen metrics align with genuine societal benefit, and how best to communicate complex results to varied audiences. My experiences thus far have provided me with both the optimism that data-driven solutions can offer transformative value and the healthy caution to approach new undertakings with a critical, conscientious mindset. I am eager to build upon these foundations in future projects.</p>
