									<p><strong>Navigating the Generative AI Surge: A Reflection on Global Governance Principles and Professional Responsibilities</strong> 
									<li>
 1  From AI Winter to Generative Spring
Late 2022 marked a watershed: public releases of ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion showcased models that could produce coherent text, images and even code on demand. While artificial intelligence (AI) research has existed for decades, these systems scaled capabilities and public adoption at an unprecedented speed. For computer‑science professionals the renaissance is both exhilarating and daunting: the same technologies that write boiler‑plate functions can also write malicious code or hallucinate legal citations. In such a fluid environment clear, enforceable and globally interoperable governance is no longer a luxury—it is a prerequisite for responsible innovation.

									<p><strong>Peer Responses Response 1: </strong>

The 2017 WannaCry attack was a major cyberattack which affected many organizations around the world, not only the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). The NHS was one of the organizations that was the most severely affected since many of their computers were still running outdated software, specifically Windows XP. The attack happened in 2017, in April 2014 Microsoft stopped supporting windows XP. This means that after April 2014 Microsoft will no longer provide security updates to the operating system and organizations should not assume that they are protected against malware and that their data is safe.
Many organizations, to this day, focus on keeping their servers up to date with the latest security patches, but they are neglecting updates to employees’ computers. The organization I work for has now, in 2024 send out communication that all employees should update their laptops to the latest Windows 11 operating system. This is three years after the release of Windows 11. The organization is not enforcing this update, and they have no way of knowing if people are performing this update. From experience what we will see is once an employee’s computer gets infected or attacked, only then will the organization enforce the update, which by this time will be too late.
According to (Acronis, 2020) insufficient funding was the main reason for the NHS not conforming to cyber security standards, only after the attack did government heavily invest in cyber security for the NHS. This incident is a key example of reactive rather than proactive cybersecurity measures. We need to understand that as healthcare increasingly relies on Artificial Intelligence and connected devices, the risk of cyber disruption also grows. Proactive measures must be implemented to prevent potential security breaches, rather than waiting to address vulnerabilities after incidents occur. </p>

										<p><strong>Response 2:</strong>
Good post, Mavis. I also read that the 2017 WannaCry attack on the NHS was preventable, so this was negligence and harm done by the Department of Health and the NHS's management (BBC, 2017). They were aware that their systems were outdated, but did not take action to update them or have security against things like ransomware and malware. This has been an ongoing issue since 2014, and the NHS had no process of assessing their technology security or checking for vulnerabilities. Almost 7000 appointments were canceled because of the WannaCry ransomware. Experts said the attack could have been prevented if they had kept their Windows system up to date, but they had not. It was a simple solution to an arguably preventable problem because the ransomware was not sophisticated either.</p>

									<p><strong>Summary Post:</strong>
In Summary, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack on the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) highlights the critical intersection of Industry 4.0 advancements and cybersecurity requirements. As healthcare systems integrate IoT, AI, and big data to improve patient outcomes and streamline services, they also become more susceptible to cyber threats (Schwab, 2016). In the WannaCry incident, outdated systems running Windows XP were exploited, disrupting access to Electronic Patient Records (EPRs), causing widespread appointment cancellations, and endangering patient safety (NHS England, 2023). Peer feedback underscores that, although this attack affected many organisations worldwide, the NHS’s reliance on unsupported operating systems made the impact particularly severe.

Despite awareness of these vulnerabilities, the NHS did not proactively update its software or implement adequate security measures (BBC, 2017). This oversight resulted in substantial financial losses and long-term reputational harm. One peer noted this as a clear example of reactive, rather than proactive, cybersecurity efforts—an issue still evident in numerous organisations today. A lack of enforced updates and insufficient funding further heighten these risks, particularly as healthcare increasingly relies on AI and connected devices.

The WannaCry attack therefore serves as a stark reminder of the need for ongoing risk assessments, robust patch management, and comprehensive data protection strategies. Moving forward, secure digital transformations in healthcare must be prioritised to safeguard sensitive information, maintain public trust, and ensure the full promise of Industry 4.0 is realised in a safe and effective manner.</p>

									<p><strong>Reflection:</strong>Throughout this collaborative discussion, I gained valuable insights into how rapidly advancing technologies—particularly in healthcare—necessitate proactive rather than reactive cybersecurity measures. The WannaCry attack on the NHS in 2017 illustrated the substantial risks of operating legacy systems; one peer highlighted how the NHS’s reliance on unsupported Windows XP left it vulnerable (Acronis, 2020). This incident was preventable, underlining the importance of frequent updates and robust patch management. Another peer stressed that insufficient funding and delayed responses contributed to the NHS’s predicament, demonstrating how organisational culture and priorities can compound technical vulnerabilities.

I also realised that the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IoT and AI, introduces both efficiency gains and new risks (Schwab, 2016). While connected devices can enhance patient care, they expand the potential attack surface. Effective governance, clear policies, and continuous risk assessments are therefore crucial. Additionally, discussions about AI-powered writing tools (Hutson, 2021) revealed parallel themes: although AI can improve productivity and creativity, overreliance on automated systems may compromise authenticity and integrity in academic or professional settings.

Overall, I now appreciate that the balance between innovation and security hinges on strong leadership, adequate funding, and a culture of vigilance. By embracing forward-looking strategies and ethical guidelines, organisations can harness the benefits of emerging technologies without sacrificing security or public trust.
