										<h1>Development Team Project: Project Report</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p>Throughout this project, we refined both our technical and professional skills. From a technical standpoint, we learned to handle large datasets efficiently by addressing missing values and anomalies, gained confidence in exploring distributions and correlations to manage outliers effectively, and acquired hands-on experience with unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to extract meaningful insights. We also practiced data visualization techniques using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to present our findings in clear, intuitive charts. On the professional side, we simulated real-life collaborative environments by assigning specific roles. I was in charge of the weekly minute meetings; two team members were in charge or the coding and one team member was in charge of bringing all the results into a 1,000-word project. We individually explored the data but collectively discussed it. Adhering to strict deadlines enhanced our time management skills, and we honed our communication abilities by presenting complex technical results in language accessible to executive stakeholders.</p>
									<p>For this project, our team worked with the publicly available Airbnb dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv) to perform a comprehensive business analysis using data science and machine learning techniques. For the team submission, we collaborated to propose an interesting business-oriented question relevant to Airbnb, conduct the necessary data analysis, and present our findings in a 1000-word analytical report. Our analytical project, titled “Understanding and Predicting Airbnb Prices in New York City,” focused on identifying key variables that influence Airbnb listing prices across NYC’s five boroughs and on building a modestly performing predictive model. By examining a dataset of over 48,000 Airbnb listings (sourced from Kaggle), the analysis unveiled the effects of factors such as location, room type, reviews, availability, and minimum stay requirements on listing prices. Although the final model explained around 57% of the price variability, it offered valuable insights for both hosts and Airbnb to fine-tune pricing strategies and maximise revenue.</p>
									<p>This project demonstrated that location and room type are the leading drivers of Airbnb prices in New York City, while other variables exert smaller but still meaningful effects. Though the model’s accuracy is moderate, it delivers practical guidance for dynamic pricing, host advisement, and competitive benchmarking. Future work-incorporating additional property features or employing advanced machine learning methods-could further refine the model’s predictive capability and offer even more robust price recommendations.</p>
								
								<strong>Meeting Minutes</strong>
<ul>1) We initially followed the team contract procedure to establish skills between each other in order to distribute tasks, this was sent to our lecturer.</ul>
<ul>2) We established our goal and collectively chose a topic for our project.</ul>
<ul>3) We assembled deadlines on what tasks to complete so we could collectively work through it together so participation for meetings would be efficient in terms of evaluating outcomes.</ul>
<ul>4) Meetings minutes and outcomes of all tasks were documented in.</ul>
